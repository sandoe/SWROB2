\begin{abstract}
	\textit{This report presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of an autonomous mobile robot integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS). The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how various tasks, including mapping, localization, navigation, motor control, and camera-based perception algorithms, can be solved using ROS. The robot system is tested in a controlled environment (Shannon). The results from the demo day are analyzed, highlighting the robot's capabilities and identifying areas for improvement. The report also discusses alternative tools and algorithms to enhance performance against predefined objectives and suggests directions for future work.
