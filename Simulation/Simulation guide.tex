	\section{ROS Network Configuration Guide}
	\subsection{Introduction}
	Before diving into multi-machine communication with ROS, it's crucial to set up your network configurations correctly. This section guides you through configuring the \texttt{ROS\_MASTER\_URI} and \texttt{ROS\_IP} environment variables, ensuring your ROS nodes can find and communicate with each other across a network.
	
	\subsection{Prerequisites}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ensure ROS Noetic is installed on all machines involved.
		\item Determine the IP addresses of the machines. You can use the \texttt{hostname -I} or \texttt{ifconfig} command on Linux to find out your IP address.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Configuration Steps}
	\subsubsection{Identify the ROS Master Machine}
	Decide which machine will run the ROS Master. This is typically the machine that initiates the ROS network.
	
	\subsubsection{Configure the \texttt{ROS\_MASTER\_URI}}
	On \textbf{every} machine that will participate in the ROS network, open the \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc} file in a text editor. For example, you can use \texttt{nano \textasciitilde/.bashrc}.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing \texttt{YOUR\_MASTER\_IP} with the IP address of the machine running the ROS Master:
		\begin{verbatim}
			export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://YOUR_MASTER_IP:11311
		\end{verbatim}
		\item Save and close the file.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsubsection{Set the \texttt{ROS\_IP}}
	Still in the \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc} file of \textbf{each} machine, add another line to specify the \texttt{ROS\_IP}, replacing \texttt{YOUR\_MACHINE\_IP} with the machine's IP address:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
		\begin{verbatim}
			export ROS_IP=YOUR_MACHINE_IP
		\end{verbatim}
		\item Save and close the file.
	\end{enumerate}
	If you are having trouble to connect even though you are using the right IP then you can try \texttt{0.0.0.0}.
	
	\subsubsection{Apply the Configuration}
	To apply the changes, source the \texttt{\textasciitilde/.bashrc} file by running:
	\begin{verbatim}
		source ~/.bashrc
	\end{verbatim}
	Do this on each machine.
	
	\subsubsection{Verify the Configuration}
	Verify that the environment variables are set correctly by running:
	\begin{verbatim}
		echo $ROS_MASTER_URI
		echo $ROS_IP
	\end{verbatim}
	Ensure that the output matches the IP addresses you configured.
	
	\subsection{Troubleshooting Tips}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If ROS nodes cannot communicate, double-check the IP addresses and ensure there are no typos.
		\item Ensure there's no firewall blocking the communication on port \texttt{11311}.
		\item Use the \texttt{ping} command to check network connectivity between machines.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	By following these steps, you've configured your machines for ROS networking, allowing ROS nodes on different machines to communicate seamlessly. This setup is essential for distributed ROS applications and multi-robot systems.

	\section{Setting Up ROS Workspace}
	First, we need to create a new ROS workspace, which is a directory where your ROS projects will reside.
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
		cd ~/catkin_ws/
	\end{verbatim}
	Initialize the workspace with \texttt{catkin\_make}:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		catkin_make
	\end{verbatim}
	Source your new workspace so ROS can find the packages you develop:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\section{Create a ROS Package}
	Now that your workspace is set up, let's create a new ROS package using roscpp.
	\\\\
	\noindent Navigate to the \texttt{src} directory in your workspace:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		cd ~/catkin_ws/src
	\end{verbatim}
	Create a new package. We'll name it \texttt{my\_roscpp\_package} and include dependencies for roscpp and std\_msgs:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		catkin_create_pkg my_roscpp_package roscpp std_msgs
	\end{verbatim}
	Build your workspace to ensure your new package is set up correctly:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		cd ~/catkin_ws
		catkin_make
	\end{verbatim}
	\clearpage
	\section{Installing Gazebo and Rviz Plugin}
	\subsection{Installing the Camera Plugin}
	After creating backups of the necessary files, proceed with the installation of the camera plugin by modifying the TurtleBot3's URDF/Xacro files to include the camera specifications and the associated Gazebo plugin.
	
	\subsubsection{Add the Camera Model to the URDF/Xacro File}
	To integrate the camera into your TurtleBot3 model, you need to edit the\\
	\texttt{turtlebot3\_[model].urdf.xacro} file, which describes your robot's physical structure. Here, you will reference the camera's Xacro file that you have created or will create.
	\\\\
	First, if not already created, make a new Xacro file named 
	\texttt{turtlebot3\_camera.xacro} within the \texttt{turtlebot3\_description/urdf} directory with the camera specifications. This file should define the camera as a separate component of your robot, specifying its size, position, and orientation relative to the robot.
	\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{\texttt{turtlebot3\_camera.xacro}}
	\begin{verbatim}
		<?xml version="1.0"?>
		<robot xmlns:xacro="http://www.ros.org/wiki/xacro">
		<xacro:macro name="turtlebot3_camera" params="parent_link">
		<!-- Definer kameraets link -->
		<link name="camera_link">
		<inertial>
		<mass value="0.001"/>
		<origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
		<inertia ixx="1e-6" iyy="1e-6" izz="1e-6" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyz="0"/>
		</inertial>
		<visual>
		<origin xyz="0 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
		<geometry>
		<box size="0.05 0.05 0.05"/>
		</geometry>
		<material name="black"/>
		</visual>
		</link>
		
		<!-- Fastgør kameraets link til robotten med et fast joint -->
		<joint name="camera_joint" type="fixed">
		<origin xyz="0.1 0 0.2" rpy="0 0 0"/>
		<parent link="${parent_link}"/>
		<child link="camera_link"/>
		</joint>
		
		<!-- Gazebo plugin for at simulere kameraet og publicere billeder til ROS -->
		<gazebo reference="camera_link">
		<sensor type="camera" name="turtlebot3_camera_sensor">
		<update_rate>30.0</update_rate>
		<camera>
		<horizontal_fov>1.3962634</horizontal_fov>
		<image>
		<width>640</width>
		<height>480</height>
		<format>R8G8B8</format>
		</image>
		<clip>
		<near>0.02</near>
		<far>300</far>
		</clip>
		</camera>
		<plugin name="camera_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_camera.so">
		<cameraName>camera</cameraName>
		<imageTopicName>image_raw</imageTopicName>
		<cameraInfoTopicName>camera_info</cameraInfoTopicName>
		<frameName>camera_link</frameName>
		<hackBaseline>0.07</hackBaseline>
		</plugin>
		</sensor>
		</gazebo>
		</xacro:macro>
		</robot>
	\end{verbatim}
	Then, in your robot model's URDF/Xacro file (e.g., \texttt{turtlebot3\_burger.urdf.xacro}), include this camera Xacro file at the top with the following line:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		<xacro:include filename="$(find turtlebot3_description)/urdf/turtlebot3_camera.xacro"/>
	\end{verbatim}
	And instantiate the camera component within the robot model where appropriate, typically near the end of the file before the closing \texttt{</robot>} tag, like so:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		<xacro:turtlebot3_camera parent_link="base_link" />
	\end{verbatim}
	This tells the URDF processor to include your camera component as part of the TurtleBot3 model, attaching it to the `base\_link` or another specified parent link.
	
	\subsubsection{Integrate the Camera Plugin in Gazebo Configuration}
	Next, you'll modify the \texttt{turtlebot3\_[model].gazebo.xacro} file to include the Gazebo plugin for the camera, enabling simulation and ROS interaction. Add the detailed Gazebo plugin configuration as shown previously. This code snippet specifies how the camera is simulated within Gazebo, including its field of view, image resolution, and the topics over which image data is published.
	\\\\
	Remember to replace the placeholder `[model]` with your specific TurtleBot3 model, such as `burger` or `waffle`.
	
	\subsection{Testing the Camera Integration}
	After integrating the camera into your TurtleBot3 model and its Gazebo simulation environment, it's crucial to test and ensure everything is working as expected. Follow these steps to compile your ROS workspace, launch the Gazebo simulation, and visualize the camera feed:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		cd ~/catkin_ws
		catkin_make
		source devel/setup.bash
		roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
	\end{verbatim}
	Then, use ROS tools such as \texttt{rqt\_image\_view} to visualize the camera feed and confirm the camera has been successfully integrated:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
	\end{verbatim}
	Select the appropriate topic (e.g., `/camera/image\_raw`) to view the live feed from the TurtleBot3 camera.
	\\\\
	This section provides a comprehensive guide to integrating a camera into the TurtleBot3 robot for use within the Gazebo simulation environment, covering file modification, plugin integration, and testing procedures. It's designed to be accessible even to those new to working with ROS and Gazebo.
	
	
	\section{Write Your First ROS Node in C++}
	Let's create a simple "Hello World" node.
	\\\\
	\noindent Create a cpp file in your package's \texttt{src} directory. Name it \texttt{hello\_world.cpp}:
	\begin{verbatim}
		cd ~/catkin_ws/src/my_roscpp_package/src
		touch hello_world.cpp
	\end{verbatim}
	Edit \texttt{hello\_world.cpp}. Use a text editor \textit{(nano)} to write the following code:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		#include <ros/ros.h>
		
		int main(int argc, char **argv) {
			ros::init(argc, argv, "hello_world_node");
			ros::NodeHandle nh;
			
			ROS_INFO("Hello, World from ROS!");
			
			ros::spin();
			return 0;
		}
	\end{verbatim}
	\noindent Go to the folder by typing
	\begin{verbatim}
		cd ~/catkin_ws/src/my_roscpp_package/
	\end{verbatim}
	Update \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} to include your node. Open \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} in your package's root directory, and add the following:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		add_executable(hello_world_node src/hello_world.cpp)
		target_link_libraries(hello_world_node ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
	\end{verbatim}
	\clearpage
	\noindent This tells CMake that you want to build 
	\texttt{hello\_world.cpp} as an executable file \\(\texttt{hello\_world\_node}).
	It needs to be looking like this inside \texttt{CMakeLists.txt}:

	\noindent Build your package again from the workspace root:
	\begin{verbatim}
		cd ~/catkin_ws
		catkin_make
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\section{Run Your ROS Node}
	Make sure ROS master is running by opening a new terminal and typing:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		roscore
	\end{verbatim}
	In another terminal, run your node:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		rosrun my_roscpp_package hello_world_node
	\end{verbatim}
	You should now see a "Hello, World from ROS!" message in the terminal.
	
	\section{Source Your Environment (if necessary)}
	If you open a new terminal and ROS cannot find your package or node, you may need to source your workspace's setup script again:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	\end{verbatim}
	This is the basic process for creating and running a simple ROS node in C++ using roscpp. From here, you can start expanding your node with more functionality, subscribing to topics, publishing messages, and much more.
	
	\section{Installing MATLAB on Ubuntu with Robotics Toolbox}
	\subsection{Introduction}
	This guide will walk you through the process of installing MATLAB on Ubuntu and ensuring that the Robotics Toolbox is included as part of your installation.
	
	\subsection{Step 1: Download MATLAB}
	First, you need to download MATLAB from the official MathWorks website.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Visit \url{https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html} and log in with your MathWorks account. If you do not already have an account, you will need to create one.
		\item Once logged in, navigate to the downloads section and select the Linux platform for download.
		\item Download the installer file to your Ubuntu machine.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Step 2: Prepare the Installation}
	After downloading, make the installer executable and run it.
	\begin{verbatim}
	$ cd ~/Downloads
	$ chmod +x matlab_R20XXx_glnxa64.sh
	$ sudo ./matlab_R20XXx_glnxa64.sh
	\end{verbatim}
	Replace \texttt{R20XXx} with the actual version of MATLAB you have downloaded.
	
	\subsection{Step 3: Complete the Installation}
	Follow the on-screen installation guide.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item When prompted, log in with your MathWorks account.
		\item Accept the license agreement.
		\item Select the installation folder (default is usually fine).
		\item When you reach the step to choose the products you want to install, make sure to \textbf{check Robotics Toolbox}.
		\item Continue through the installation wizard and finish the installation.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Step 4: Activate MATLAB}
	After installation, you need to activate MATLAB with your license. This is usually done at the first startup of MATLAB.
	
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	After these steps, MATLAB should be installed on your Ubuntu machine with the Robotics Toolbox ready for use. For further support, visit the official MathWorks support page.
